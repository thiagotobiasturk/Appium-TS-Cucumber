# Writing Tests with Cucumber  ‚úèÔ∏è

Welcome to the guide on writing tests using Cucumber! This document will help you understand the common types of steps and structures used in Cucumber to create effective and readable tests.

## Cucumber Basics

Cucumber is a tool that supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD). It allows you to write tests in plain language, which are then executed by your test automation framework. Cucumber tests are written in `.feature` files using Gherkin syntax.

### Types of Steps ### 
The `Given` step defines the initial context or state of the system before the action is performed. It sets up the preconditions for the scenario.

**Example:**
```gherkin
Given the user is on the login page
```
`When`
The When step describes the action or event that occurs in the scenario. It is the main part of the test where the behavior under test is triggered.

**Example:**
```gherkin
When the user enters valid credentials
```

`Then`
The Then step specifies the expected outcome or result after the action has been performed. It asserts that the system behaves as expected.

**Example:**
```gherkin
Then the user should be redirected to the dashboard
```

### Scenario Outlines ###
`Scenario Outline` allows you to run the same scenario with different sets of data. This is useful for testing various input combinations without duplicating scenarios.

**Example:**
```gherkin
Scenario Outline: User login with multiple credentials
  Given the user is on the login page
  When the user enters <username> and <password>
  Then the user should be redirected to the dashboard

  Examples:
    | username | password |
    | user1    | pass1    |
    | user2    | pass2    |
```

### Background ###
The `Background` section is used to define a common context for all scenarios in a feature file. It runs before each scenario, ensuring a consistent starting point.

**Example:**
```gherkin
Feature: User login

  Background:
    Given the user is on the login page

  Scenario: User logs in with valid credentials
    When the user enters valid credentials
    Then the user should be redirected to the dashboard

  Scenario: User logs in with invalid credentials
    When the user enters invalid credentials
    Then an error message should be displayed
```

### Regular Scenarios ###

Regular Scenario blocks are used to describe a single behavior of the system under test. Each scenario should be a complete example of a feature or functionality.

**Example:**
```gherkin

Scenario: User logs in with valid credentials
  Given the user is on the login page
  When the user enters valid credentials
  Then the user should be redirected to the dashboard

```


## Page Objects  ‚å®Ô∏è

`Page Objects` are a design pattern used to create a repository for the UI elements and actions associated with a particular page of your application. They help in abstracting and encapsulating the page's elements and behaviors, making your tests more readable and maintainable.

In this framework, the `Login` page object is defined as follows:

**`Login.page.ts`**
```typescript
class Login {
    get usernameInput() { return $('//android.widget.EditText[@text="Email"]'); }
    get passwordInput() { return $('//android.widget.EditText[@text="Password"]'); }
    get submitButton() { return $('(//android.widget.TextView[@text="Sign In"])[2]'); }
    get successMessage() { return $('//android.widget.ScrollView/android.view.ViewGroup'); }
    get unsuccessfulMessage() { return $('//android.widget.TextView[@text="Incorrect email or password."]'); }
    get open() { return $('//android.view.View'); }

    async openview() {
        await this.open;
    }

    async setUsername(username) { 
        await this.usernameInput.setValue(username);
    }

    async submitLoginForm() {
        await this.submitButton.click();
    }

    async setPassword(password) { 
        await this.passwordInput.setValue(password);
    }

    async loginsuccesfull() {
        await this.successMessage;
    }

    async loginunsuccessful() {
        await this.unsuccessfulMessage;
    }
}

export default new Login();
```

## Steps  ‚å®Ô∏è
The `steps` file defines the steps used in the scenarios of your feature files. Each step corresponds to a specific action or verification that is mapped to methods in the page object.

**`steps.ts`**
```typescript

import { Given, Then, When } from"@cucumber/cucumber";
import Loginfrom"../pageobjects/Login.page.js";

Given(/^I am on the login screen$/, async () => {
    await Login.openview();
});

When(/^I enter username "([^"]*)"$/, async (username) => {
    await Login.setUsername(username);
});

When(/^I tap the login button$/, async () => {
    await Login.submitLoginForm();
});

When(/^I enter password "([^"]*)"$/, async (password) => {
    await Login.setPassword(password);
});

Then(/^login is correct$/, async () => {
    awaitnewPromise(resolve =>setTimeout(resolve, 9000));
    await Login.loginsuccesfull();
});

Then(/^an error message is displayed$/, async () => {
    awaitnewPromise(resolve =>setTimeout(resolve, 9000));
    await Login.loginunsuccessful();
});
```

4.**Edit the Desired Capabilities**:

**Update the following fields with the data from your emulator**:

`appium:platformVersion`: Set this to the version of Android running on your emulator `(e.g., '12.0')`.

`appium:deviceName`: Set this to the name of your emulator `(e.g., 'Pixel_5')`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40e81bde-9e9a-4160-9737-4489492ee254)

## Run Test  üíª
To run the tests, use the following command:

**for android**
```bash
npm run test.android
```
**for ios**
```bash
npm run test.ios
```

**Note: When running the tests, ensure that the Appium server is turned off. The test framework configuration file will start the Appium server automatically**.

When you add a new feature to the project, follow these steps to ensure it is properly integrated with the testing framework:

## Updating Step Files

When adding a new step file for a feature, follow these steps:

1. **Add the Step File**

   Create a new step file in the `tests/steps` directory. Ensure that the file has a `.ts` extension and follows the appropriate format for your Cucumber steps.

2. **Update the Configuration File**

   You need to update the WebDriverIO configuration to include the new step file. This configuration file is located at `config/wdio.android.cucumber.conf.ts`.

   Open `config/wdio.android.cucumber.conf.ts` and locate the `cucumberOpts` configuration section. Within this section, you‚Äôll find a property called `require` that specifies the step files Cucumber should load.

   ```typescript
   cucumberOpts: {
       require: [
           path.join(__dirname, '..', 'tests', 'steps', 'login_faster_steps.ts'),
                                                        // Add the new step file here
       ]
   }

## How to generate a test report  üóÇÔ∏è


run the command

```bash
npm run report
```

after the tests have completed.
